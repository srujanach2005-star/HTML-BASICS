2.HTML document structure?

#🏗️ Basic HTML Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>

</body>
</html>

#🔎 Explanation of Each Part
1️⃣ <!DOCTYPE html> = Declares the document type.
                    Tells the browser this is HTML5.

2️⃣ <html>           = Root element of the webpage.
                      All content must be inside this tag.
                      lang="en" specifies the language.

3️⃣ <head>               = Contains meta information about the page (not visible directly):
 <meta charset="UTF-8"> → Supports all characters
 <meta name="viewport"> → Makes website responsive
 <title>                → Appears in browser tab

 4️⃣ <body>              = Contains all visible content
                           Headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, links, etc
